## Projet_Capteur_Coussen_Barnova
 2021-2022
 Low-tech pencil drawn strain gauge sensor developed in 4th year Engineering Physics course MOSH (Microcontroller Open Source Hardware) at INSA (National Institute of Applied Sciences) Toulouse.

We were inspired by Scientific Reports article "Pencil Drawn Strain Gauges and Chemiresistors on Paper" written by Cheng-Wei Lin, Zhibo Zhao, Jaemyung Kim & Jiaxing Huang. This article can be found in our repository.

Can we fabricate reliable sensors made of pencil drawn paper?

# Idea
Pencil carbon deposited on the paper contains percolated graphite particles network where electrons move. Mechanism enabling electrons to move from grain to grain is tunnelling through potential barrier. However, tunnelling depends exponentially on the length of the barrier. When a mechanical stress is applied to the gauge, grains of percolated network spread away. Thus, when a tension is applied to gauge electrons move less. Resistance increases. When gauge is compressed electrons move more and resistance decreases.
